## For people using Apple M1 computers

If you get an error that reads similar to:

    mach-o, but wrong architecture

The likely issue is that a Python dependency of Dagster's (or another package you're trying to install) is incompatible with your Apple M1 computer. The incompatibility is because some of the package's dependencies run code specific to the computer's architecture, such as x86 or ARM. This issue is most common when working on Macs with an M1 chip.

To find out if your Mac has an M1 chip, follow the instructions [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/706226/how-to-check-if-your-mac-is-using-an-intel-or-apple-silicon-processor/).

To work around this, you'll need to use macOS [Rosetta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment).

1. Install Rosetta.

   [Rosetta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment) is Apple's software to emulate an x86 architecture environment on their M1 chip's ARM architecture.

   To install Rosetta, open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
   ```

2. Create another terminal that will default to running the Rosetta x86 emulator.

   1. Go to `Finder` > `Applications` and find your terminal app.
   2. Right-click the terminal app and make a new terminal app by clicking `Duplicate`.
   3. Right-click the new terminal > `Get Info` > `Enable Open using Rosetta`.
   4. Open the newly duplicated terminal app.
   5. Type `arch` into the terminal prompt.
   6. If the output says `i386`, then the installation and creation of the x86 emulator works.
   7. From now on, use this terminal while working with your Dagster project.

   For more details, you can you look at [this Stack Overflow post](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/428768/on-apple-m1-with-rosetta-how-to-open-entire-terminal-iterm-in-x86-64-architec)

3. In your Rosetta terminal, install `homebrew`.

   ```bash
   arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

4. Confirm that the correct `homebrew` installation is used in your Rosetta terminal. Add the following snippet to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or profile manager of choice. If you are unfamiliar with profile managers, you likely should use `~/.bashrc`.

   ```bash
   arch_name="$(uname -m)"

   if [ "${arch_name}" = "x86_64" ]; then
      echo "Running in x86 mode"
      eval $(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)
   elif [ "${arch_name}" = "arm64" ]; then
      echo "Running in Arm mode"
      eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)
   else
      echo "Unexpected uname -m result ${arch_name}"
   fi

   # brew libraries
   export LDFLAGS="-L $(brew --prefix openssl)/lib"
   export CFLAGS="-I $(brew --prefix openssl)/include"
   ```

Save the file and restart your terminal. You can check that the correct version of `homebrew` is being used by confirming the output of `which brew` is `/usr/local/bin/brew`.
