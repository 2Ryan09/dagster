## Installing Dagster

To install Dagster and Dagit into an existing Python environment, run:

```bash
pip install dagster dagit
```

This will install the latest stable version of the core Dagster packages in your current Python environment.

**Note for Macs with an M1 or M2 chip**: Since users have reported installation problems due to missing wheels for arm64 Macs in the standard `grpcio` package, the `dagster` Python package includes its own pre-built wheel of the `grpcio` package for M1 and M2 users at version 1.47.2. To opt out of using our wheel and use the standard `grpcio` build process instead, run `DAGSTER_M1_DEFAULT_GRPCIO=1 pip install dagster dagit` instead.

## Python version and environment

<DagsterVersion />

To check that Python and the pip package manager are already installed in your environment, you can run:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

We strongly recommend installing Dagster inside a Python virtualenv. If you are running Anaconda, you should install Dagster inside a Conda environment.

If you would like to install Dagster from source, please see the section on [Contributing](/community/contributing).
