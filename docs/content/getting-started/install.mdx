## Installing Dagster

- `dagster` is the command line interface (CLI) tool to run Dagster. It also is the stateless, single-node, single-process and multi-process execution engines
- `dagit` is the web-based UI for operating Dagster, including ways to visualize your DAGs, a type-aware config editor, and a live execution interface.

To install Dagster and Dagit into an existing Python environment, run:

```bash
pip install dagster dagit
```

This will install the latest stable version of the core Dagster packages in your current Python environment.

## Python version and environment

<!-- Lives in: /next/components/mdx/includes/dagster/DagsterVersion.mdx -->

<DagsterVersion />

To check that Python and the pip package manager are already installed in your environment, you can run:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

We strongly recommend installing Dagster inside a Python virtual environment.

- If you are unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, you can read more about them on [the official Python documentation](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
- If you are running Anaconda, you should install Dagster inside a conda environment. The official conda [documentation for managing environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) can help you get set up.
