# Installing Dagster

This guide uses pip to install Dagster.

---

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- **Python version 3.6 or later.** Dagster is tested on Python 3.9, 3.8, 3.7, and 3.6.
- **Optional: An installed Python virtualenv tool of your choice.**

---

## Step 1: Verify your setup

To check that Python and the pip package manager are already installed in your environment, run the following:

```shell
python --version
pip --version
```

---

## Step 2: Install Dagster and Dagit

We strongly recommend installing Dagster inside a Python virtualenv. If you're running Anaconda, you should install Dagster inside a Conda environment.

To install Dagster and Dagit into an existing Python environment, run:

```shell
pip install dagster dagit
```

This will install the latest stable version of the core Dagster packages in your current Python environment.

- **Dagster**, which is the core programming model. The latest stable version will be installed.
- **Dagit**, which is the [web interface](/building/using-dagit) for developing and operating Dagster jobs. 

If you would like to install Dagster from source, please see the section on Contributing.
