# Defining An Asset

This is part one of three in the Dagster assets intro tutorial:

1. **Defining an asset**
2. [Building graphs of assets](/tutorial/intro-tutorial/assets/asset-graph)
3. [Testing assets](/tutorial/intro-tutorial/assets/testing-assets)

In this part, you'll create and materialize your first asset in Dagster using a CSV dataset. The dataset, `cereal.csv`, contains nutritional facts about 80 breakfast cereals.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, complete the [setup steps](/tutorial/intro-tutorial/setup).

---

## Step 1: Creating the asset

Let's write our first Dagster asset and save it as `cereal.py`.

A [software-defined asset](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) specifies an asset that you want to exist and how to compute its contents. Typically, you'll define assets by annotating ordinary Python functions with the <PyObject module="dagster" object="asset" decorator /> decorator.

Our first asset represents a dataset of cereal data, downloaded from the internet:

```python file=/guides/dagster/asset_tutorial/cereal.py startafter=start_asset_marker endbefore=end_asset_marker
import csv
import requests
from dagster import asset


@asset
def cereals():
    response = requests.get("https://docs.dagster.io/assets/cereal.csv")
    lines = response.text.split("\n")
    cereal_rows = [row for row in csv.DictReader(lines)]

    return cereal_rows
```

In this case, our asset doesn't depend on any other assets.

## Step 2: Materializing the asset

"Materializing" an asset means computing its contents and writing them to persistent storage. By default, Dagster pickles the value returned by the function and stores it the local filesystem, using the name of the asset as the name of the file. Where and how the contents are stored is fully customizable - e.g. you might store them in a database or a cloud object store like S3. We'll look at how that works later.

Assuming youâ€™ve saved this code as `cereal.py`, you can execute it via two different mechanisms:

- [Dagit](#dagit), a web-based interface for interacting with Dagster objects
- [Dagster's Python API](#python-api)

### Dagit

To visualize your assets in Dagit, run the following command in the directory that contains the file:

```bash
dagit -f cereal.py
```

When Dagit is up and running, you'll see something like this:

```bash
Serving dagit on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process 70635
```

Navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000> in your web browser to view the asset:

<img src="/images/dagster/guides/asset-tutorial/defining-an-asset/defining_an_asset.png" />

To launch a run that materializes the asset, click **Materialize All**.

After the run completes, the **Materialized** and **Last Run** attributes in the asset will be populated. To view a stream of logs and events that occurred during the asset's materialization, click the run ID. This is the string of characters next to **Last Run**:

<img src="/images/tutorial/assets/link_to_run_logs.png" />

In this view, you can filter and search through the logs for the run that materialized the asset:

<img src="/images/tutorial/assets/asset_run_logs.png" />

To view detailed info about the asset, click the **cereals** link next to the **Success** indicator in the upper left corner of the page:

<img src="/images/tutorial/assets/link_to_asset_details.png" />

You can also access the **Asset Details** page by clicking **Assets** in the upper right corner of the page, then clicking the asset in the list that displays.

Success!

### Python API

If you'd rather materialize your asset without Dagit, add a few lines to `cereal.py`. This executes a run within the Python process:

```python file=/guides/dagster/asset_tutorial/cereal.py startafter=start_materialize_marker endbefore=end_materialize_marker
from dagster import AssetGroup

if __name__ == "__main__":
    AssetGroup([cereals]).materialize()
```

And now you can run:

```bash
python cereal.py
```

Success!

## What's next?

In this tutorial, you:

- Defined your first asset
- Materialized the asset using Dagit or Dagster's Python API

In the second part of this tutorial, we'll build on what you learned by creating graphs of assets.
