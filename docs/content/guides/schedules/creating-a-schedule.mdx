# Running an Asset on a Schedule

Once you have created a [Software-Defined Asset](/concepts/assets/software-defiend-assets), the natural next step is to run it automatically on a schedule.

In Dagster, there are two ways in which assets are automatically run on a schedule:

- [Schedules and Jobs](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules)
- [Auto-Materialized Policies](/concepts/assets/asset-auto-execution)

In this guide, we will show you how to use both of these methods to automatically run your assets on a defined schedule.

Our example will create two assets, `hello` and `world`, and then run them on a predefined cron schedule at 4am.

## Using Schedules and Jobs

In Dagster, Schedules are attached to a [Job](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs) and are used to run a pipeline on a schedule.

A Schedule is a good choice for running a set of assets on a schedule if those assets are attached to a job.

First, we will define two assets that we wish to run on a schedule:

```python file=/concepts/schedules/schedule-assets.py startafter=start_asset_marker endbefore=end_asset_marker
from dagster import asset


@asset
def hello():
    return "hello"


@asset(deps=[hello])
def world():
    return "world"
```

Since a schedule requires a job to be defined, our next step is to add these assets to a job. We will use the `asset_name*` [`AssetSelection`](/\_apidocs/assets#dagster.AssetSelection) syntax to select the `hello` job and all downstream assets:

```python file=/concepts/schedules/schedule-assets.py startafter=start_job_marker endbefore=end_job_marker
from dagster import define_asset_job

hello_world_job = define_asset_job("hello_world_job", selection="hello+")
```

With the assets defined and attached to a job, we can now define a schedule that will run the job at 4am every day:

```python file=/concepts/schedules/schedule-assets.py startafter=start_schedule_marker endbefore=end_schedule_marker
from dagster import ScheduleDefinition

hello_schedule = ScheduleDefinition(
    name="my_first_schedule",
    cron_schedule="0 4 * * *",
    job=hello_world_job,
    description="A daily schedule that says hello and world",
)
```

With our assets and schedule defined, we can now add them to a Definitions, which will allow Dagster to see what we have just created:

```python file=/concepts/schedules/schedule-assets.py startafter=start_pipeline_marker endbefore=end_pipeline_marker
from dagster import Definitions

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[hello, world],
    jobs=[hello_world_job],
    schedules=[hello_schedule],
)
```

Here is the full code from our example.

```python file=/concepts/schedules/schedule-assets.py hidecomments=true
from dagster import asset


@asset
def hello():
    return "hello"


@asset(deps=[hello])
def world():
    return "world"



from dagster import define_asset_job

hello_world_job = define_asset_job("hello_world_job", selection="hello+")


from dagster import ScheduleDefinition

hello_schedule = ScheduleDefinition(
    name="my_first_schedule",
    cron_schedule="0 4 * * *",
    job=hello_world_job,
    description="A daily schedule that says hello and world",
)



from dagster import Definitions

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[hello, world],
    jobs=[hello_world_job],
    schedules=[hello_schedule],
)
```

If we save this file, for example, to `hello-schedule.py` then we can test it out by running:

```shell
dagster dev -f hello-schedule.py
```

You can try Materializing the asset by clicking on it and clicking Materialize Asset, and you can confirm the schedule has been created by visiting the Schedules page under Overview.

Note that Schedules must be explicitly enabled before they will run.

## Using Auto-Materialized Policies

Another approach to automating the execution of assets is to use [Auto-Materialized Policies](/concepts/assets/asset-auto-execution). Auto-Materialized Policies help reduce the complexity of scheduling assets by enabling a declarative approach to scheduling. While there are many possible policies that you can use, we will focus on the [`AutoMaterializeRule.materialize_on_cron`](/assets#dagster.AutoMaterializeRule.materialize_on_cron) rule, which will automatically materialize an asset on a cron schedule, similar to the schedule we created above.

First, we'll define a `AutoMaterializePolicy.eager` which we will supplement with a `materialize_on_cron` Rule.

The `AutoMaterializePolicy.eager` policy will automatically materialize an asset when its parent has been updated or if it has never been materialized before by default. We add a cron-schedule to ensure that the asset is also materialized on a schedule.

Next, we apply the policy we created to the `world` asset. Dagster will now run the `world` aset on a schedule and whenever its parent `hello` asset is updated.

Note that there is a subtle difference between the AutoMaterializePolicy and our original Schedule. Here, Dagster is more eager about ensuring this asset gets updated.

We've also only applied the policy the final asset, which means the `hello` asset will not automatically be updated. If we wanted to ensure both are updated, we could apply the same policy to both assets.

```python file=/concepts/schedules/schedule-assets.py startafter=start_policy_marker endbefore=end_policy_marker
No match for startAfter value "start_policy_marker"
```
