# Guide to Dagster's supporting files

This guide to the supporting files in Dagster is intended to help you understand the purpose of each file in the Dagster repository. 

## Overview 

This guide provides an overview of each of the supporting documents and which of those apply to the different types of Dagster deployments and local development. 



| File type | Used for | Path | OSS | Cloud |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dagster.yaml` | Configure your dagster instance  | root | Optional | Optional |
| `pyproject.toml` | Defines the Dagster code package | root | Single Code Location  |  |
| `workspace.yaml` | Open source deployments for code locations  | root | Multiple code locations  | dagster_cloud.yaml used instead |
| `dagster_cloud.yaml` | Code locations for cloud  | root |  | Multiple code locations |
| `deployment_settings.yaml` |  |  | optional | optional  |
| `setup.py` |  |  |  |   |
| `setup.cfg` |  |  |  |   |

## Files and what they do

### dagster.yaml

[dagster-instance](https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/dagster-instance)

[Other settings](https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/logging/python-logging#configuring-a-python-log-level-)

### pyproject.toml

The pyproject.toml file is used to specify your Dagster code package and allows you to use 'dagster dev' to load in your dagster code without any parameters. This file is automatically generated when using 'dagster project scaffold' [here](/getting-started/create-new-project#bootstrapping-a-new-project). 

An example of this file can be found [here](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/blob/83cd203000f96574bd4edda2f42b5f7f5c9c1c4d/examples/project_fully_featured/pyproject.toml).

### workspace.yaml

[Workspace files](https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files)

### dagster_cloud.yaml


### deployment_settings.yaml


### setup.py


### setup.cfg

## Dagster Scenarios and what files to use 


### OSS Local Development

When running Dagster locally, you will want to configure your `workspace.yaml` to set up your code locations. If you have multiple code locations, you will want to list them all in a single `workspace.yaml` file. For more information on setting up your `workspace.yaml`file see [https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files](https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files). 

If you want to configure things like your dagster storage, run launchers, etc. you have the option of also including a `dagster.yaml` file for these settings.

### OSS Deployment to your infrastructure

[Running Dagster locally](https://docs.dagster.io/guides/running-dagster-locally) is a great way to get started with Dagster. Once you want to move your open source deployment to production, you will want to deploy Dagster. 

The `dagster.yaml` file is where you will configure your Dagster instance. Dagster offers a [suite of guides](https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/open-source#deploying-dagster) that go through how to deploy Dagster using [Docker](https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/guides/docker), [Google Cloud Platform](https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/guides/gcp) and [Amazon Web Services using EC2 or ECS](https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/guides/aws). There are also guides for deploying with [Helm](https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/guides/kubernetes/deploying-with-helm) and [customizing your Kubernetes deployment](https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/guides/kubernetes/customizing-your-deployment). 

In addition to configuring your `dagster.yaml`, you will also still need your `workspace.yaml` to [configure your code locations](https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files#understanding-workspace-files).

### Serverless Cloud Deployment

### Hybrid Cloud Deployment
