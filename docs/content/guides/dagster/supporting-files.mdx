# Guide to Dagster's supporting files

This guide to the supporting files in Dagster is intended to help you understand the purpose of each file in the Dagster repository. 

## Overview 

This guide provides an overview of each of the supporting documents and which of those apply to the different types of Dagster deployments and local development. 



| File type | Used for | Path | OSS | Cloud |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dagster.yaml` | Configure your dagster instance  | root | Optional | Optional |
| `pyproject.toml` | Defines the Dagster code package | root | Single Code Location  | N/A |
| `workspace.yaml` | Open source deployments for code locations  | root | Multiple code locations  | dagster_cloud.yaml used instead |
| `dagster_cloud.yaml` | Code locations for cloud  | root | N/A | Multiple code locations |
| `deployment_settings.yaml` | Configuration file for full-deployments | ?? | N/A | Optional  |
| `setup.py` | Contains python dependencies for your Dagster project | root | ✅ | ✅ |
| `setup.cfg` | Defaults for `setup.py` | root | ✅ | ?? |

## Files and what they do

### `dagster.yaml`

The dagster.yaml file is used to configure various Dagster settings such as storage locations, run launchers, and sensor and schedule settings. A list of options available can be found at [dagster-instance](https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/dagster-instance).

The dagster.yaml file can also be used to [configure python log handlers](https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/logging/python-logging#configuring-python-log-handlers-). [Run coordinators](/deployment/run-coordinator#limiting-run-concurrency) can also be configured through the dagster.yaml file. 

The dagster.yaml file is also used to configure your open source Dagster deployment on your infrastructure. More information can be found in the OSS Deployment to your infrastructure section below.


### `pyproject.toml`

The pyproject.toml file is used to specify your Dagster code package and allows you to use 'dagster dev' to load in your dagster code without any parameters. This file is automatically generated when using 'dagster project scaffold' [here](/getting-started/create-new-project#bootstrapping-a-new-project). 

An example of this file can be found [here](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/blob/83cd203000f96574bd4edda2f42b5f7f5c9c1c4d/examples/project_fully_featured/pyproject.toml).

### `workspace.yaml`

When using multiple code locations with Open Source, `workspace.yaml` is used when you have more than one code location. More information on [workspace files](https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files) is found under code locations. 

### `dagster_cloud.yaml`

Similar to the `workspace.yaml` and `pyproject.toml` files for Open Source, dagster_cloud.yaml is used to set the code location for Dagster Cloud. The [dagster_cloud.yaml guide](docs/content/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/dagster-cloud-yaml) can be used to learn more about this file. 

For Hybrid Cloud Dagster deployments, `the dagster_cloud.yaml` is used for secrets management. 

### `deployment_settings.yaml`

The `deployment_settings.yaml` is used to configure settings for full deployments in Dagster Cloud. A reference for the available settings can be found [here](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/deployment-settings-reference)

### `setup.py` and `setup.cfg`

When you use the [Dagster project scaffold](https://docs.dagster.io/getting-started/create-new-project), the setup.py and setup.cfg files are automatically generated. The `setup.py` file is used to list the python package dependecies for your Dagster project. 
These files are not Dagster specific and more information can be found [here](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/datafiles.html).

## Dagster Scenarios and what files to use 

### Deployment Agnostic Use Cases

The `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `pyproject.toml`, and `dagster.yaml` files function the same way across all deployment types, with the exception that in `dagster.yaml` may contain additional configurations based on your deployment type.

### OSS Local Development

When running Dagster locally, you will want to configure your `pyproject.toml` to set up a single code location. If you have multiple code locations, you will want to list them all in a single `workspace.yaml` file. For more information on setting up your `workspace.yaml`file see [here](/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files]. 

If you want to configure things like your dagster storage, run launchers, etc. you have the option of also including a `dagster.yaml` file for these settings.

### OSS Deployment to your infrastructure

[Running Dagster locally](https://docs.dagster.io/guides/running-dagster-locally) is a great way to get started with Dagster. Once you want to move your open source deployment to production, you will want to deploy Dagster. 

The `dagster.yaml` file is where you will configure your Dagster instance. Dagster offers a [suite of guides](/deployment/open-source#deploying-dagster) that go through how to deploy Dagster using [Docker](https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/guides/docker), [Google Cloud Platform](/deployment/guides/gcp) and [Amazon Web Services using EC2 or ECS](/deployment/guides/aws). There are also guides for deploying with [Helm](https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/guides/kubernetes/deploying-with-helm) and [customizing your Kubernetes deployment](https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/guides/kubernetes/customizing-your-deployment). 

In addition to configuring your `dagster.yaml`, you will also still need your `workspace.yaml` to [configure your code locations](/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files#understanding-workspace-files).

### Serverless Cloud Deployment

For Dagster Cloud Serverless, the `dagster_cloud.yaml` file is used to configure your code locations as well as other settings. In cases where you want to configure your [deployment settings](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/deployment-settings-reference), the `deployment_settings.yaml` file is used.

### Hybrid Cloud Deployment

For Hybrid Cloud deployments, the `dagster_cloud.yaml` file is used to configure your code locations and configuring your secrets for the Hybrid deployment. 

In cases where you want to configure your [deployment settings](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/deployment-settings-reference), the `deployment_settings.yaml` file is used.
