# Adopt a new orchestrator

Leading an organization to adopt a new orchestrator can be incredibly rewarding, it is a chance to:  
- Dramatically reduce daily toil 
- Up-level the data culture for an entire organization 
- Make a case for a promotion from senior to staff data engineer

However, it can also be difficult to know how to start, with daunting questions like:  
- How do I learn a new orchestrator?  
- What capabilities matter to my team? 
- Who needs to be involved? 
- How do I align infrastructure, data security, and engineering teams?
- How can I evaluate different software quickly, while still making the right choice?
- How do I do my "day job", while also evaluating something new?
- How do I purchase new software? 

This guide provides a blueprint for data engineers who want to champion a new orchestration technology. We recommend evaluating a new orchestrator, like Dagster, in three phases: 

1. The goal of phase 1 is to learn Dagster concepts and decide if Dagster will resolve your team's most pressing pain points. Phase 1 is not concerned with your production data, integrating with your existing systems, or standing up a production architecture.

2. The goal of phase 2 is to evaluate whether Dagster will work with your organization's data, infrastructure, and architecture. Phase 2 involves running a proof of concept where you will write and deploy a minimal viable pipeline to a production-ready architecture. 

3. At the end of phase 2 your team should have made a decision about whether or not to migrate to a new orchestrator. Phase 3 is about rapidly adopting the new orchestrator.

### Phase 1

The goal of phase 1 is to learn enough about Dagster to decide if a full POC is worth your time.

#### Identify existing pain

The goal of phase 1 is to learn enough about Dagster to decide whether a full proof of concept is worthwhile. The first step for evaluating this goal is listing the pain points your team has today. For example:  

- The team struggles with debugging. Stakeholders ask about broken datasets, but it is hard to identify the runs that might have impacted a table. 
- The team is spending too much time fixing production issues that are introduced because it is hard to test code locally. 
- Addressing requests for new datasets is difficult because it is unclear what existing scheduled job and dag should be modified.
- The team is frustrated by dependency management and project structure.

After making an initial list, it can be useful to identify what impacts those paint points are having on the business. For example:

- On average, each production incident costs the company $30K because due to violated SLAs, missed conversions, or churned carts
- Dealing with technical debt costs the team $100K a year, becausehalf of a full time head count each week is spent babysitting the legacy tool

#### Learn Dagster

While it is possible to learn a new orchestrator by watching webinars, reading documentation, or writing new code fromn scratch, we believe a Dagster Cloud Quickstart is the fastest way to decide if Dagster will resolve your team's pain points. The following steps take less than an hour. 

1. Create a Dagster Cloud organization. This organization is temporary, just for learning, so don't worry about picking a long-lasting name. 
2. Select Serverless. In phase 2, you will evaluate whether a serverless, hybrid, or OSS deployment model is best suited to your organization's infrastructure. For now, serverless is the fastest way to become familiar with Dagster's capabilities.
3. Select a quickstart template. Quickstart templates allow you to evaluate common Dagster pipelines and integrations. You will have the chance to deploy real code, make changes, and see updates. 
4. After selecting a quickstart template, connect Dagster Cloud to your personal GitHub and create a new private repository. In phase 2 you will evaluate a version control and CICD structure that works for your team. For now, the goal is to make changes to Dagster and deploy those changes quickly. 
5. After deploying the quickstart, you can explore the Dagster web interface: launch runs, view assets, enable sensors and schedules. You can also make changes to the code and trigger deployments. 

At this point, you the tools to make an initial evaluation of whether Dagster's capabilities will meet your team's needs. This a great time to introduce yourself on the Dagster slack, or attend the weekly Dagster demo or community day to meet other individuals and data teams evaluating and adopting a new orchesterator.

### Phase 2

The goal of phase 2 is to solicit feedback from a wider set of stakeholders including your team, executives, and IT/Ops. At the end of phase 2 you should have a go/no-go decision for implementing a new orchestrator. While phase 2 preparations might take time in some orgs, your full time work coding the proof-of-concept is normally a single two-week sprint.

#### Identify stakeholders

- Other data engineers
- Analytic / BI engineers
- Infrastructure team 
- Executive sponsor 


#### Determine a minimum viable pipeline 
 
- Connect to real data 
- Address pain points as evaluation criteria, eg: 
    - Local development without production resources
    - CICD for deployment and PRs for staging review
    - Quick additions of new assets with declarative schedules

#### Solicit necessary support 

- InfoSec: Might require a vendor security evaluation before a POC 
- Legal: Might want a NDA signed
- Infrastructure team: Compute environment or serverless access to data
- DB admin team: Service account for DB access
- Executive sponsor: budget a two week sprint without on-call interruptions

#### Run POC 

1. Create a Dagster Cloud organization
2. Launch an agent or determine infosec requirements for serverless 
3. Setup a project in your team's Git provider
4. Setup CICS to deploy your project to Git
5. Develop dagster code to implement your minimal viable pipeline   
    - Connect to relevant data sources 


#### Present to executive stakeholders

- How to make a great case for a new orchestrator

#### Begin procurement process

- Identifying budget
- Reviewing pricing proposal
- InfoSec approval
- Legal approval

### Phase 3

The goal of phase 3 is to onboard to the new orchestrator. 

#### Complete procurement 

#### Harden infrastructure 

1. Setup SSO 
2. Enable appropriate RBAC 

#### Begin migration 

- Lift and shift 
- Gradual refactor 
- Greenfield 

#### Onboard team 

- Create internal documentation 
- Share dagster resources
