# Recommended Project Structure

Dagster aims to enable teams to ship data pipelines with extraordinary velocity. In this guide, we'll talk about how we imagine structuring larger Dagster projects which help achieve that goal.

At a high level, here are the aspects we'd like to optimize when structuring a complex project:

- You can quickly get stuff done (e.g. write a new job, fix a breakage, or retire existing data pipelines) without thinking much about where the change should be or how it may break others.
- You can quickly find the relevant code regardless of your familiarity to the related business logic.
- You can organize at your own pace when you feel things have grown too big, but not over-optimize too early.

## Recommended patterns

### For Python projects

This project was scaffolded by the `dagster project` CLI. This CLI helps generate files and folder structure that let you quickly get started with everything set up, especially the Python setup. You can read more about the default project skeleton in [Create a New Project](/getting-started/create-new-project#option-1-starting-with-the-default-project-skeleton).

### For assets

Keep all assets together in an `assets/` directory. Keep all assets in the same directory. Or, as your business logic grows, group assets by business domains in multiple directories inside `assets/`.

In this example, we keep all assets together in the [`project_fully_featured/assets/`](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples/project_fully_featured/project_fully_featured/assets) directory. It is useful because you can use <PyObject object="load_assets_from_package_module" /> or <PyObject object="load_assets_from_modules" /> to load assets into your repository, as opposed to needing to add assets to the repository every time you define one. It also helps collaboration as your teammates can quickly navigate in the right place to find the core business logic (i.e. assets) regardless of their familiarity to the codebase.

### For schedules and sensors

Keep all the policies for triggering jobs together, i.e., put most schedules and sensors together.

In this example, we put sensors and schedules in [`jobs.py`](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/blob/master/examples/project_fully_featured/project_fully_featured/jobs.py). When we build sensors or schedules from a job, they are considered as policies for when to trigger a particular job. So, keeping all the policies together with jobs makes it clear when and how certain jobs are being launched.

- Note: Certain sensors like [run status sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors#run-status-sensors) can listen to multiple jobs and do not trigger a job. We recommend keeping these sensors in the repository definition as they are often for alerting and monitoring at the repository level.

### For resources

Make resources reusable and share them across jobs or asset groups.

In this example, resources (e.g., database connections, Spark sessions, API clients, and I/O managers) are grouped in the [`resources/__init__.py`](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/blob/master/examples/project_fully_featured/project_fully_featured/resources/__init__.py) file, where they are bound to configuration sets which vary based on environment. In complex projects, we find it helpful to make resources reusable and configured with pre-defined values via <PyObject object="configured" />. So when developing a project, instead of trying to find their own way to model external components, teammates can all quickly get stuff done using a pre-defined resource set, or make changes to resources that are shared among the team.

This pattern also helps you to easily execute jobs in different environments without code changes. In this example, we dynamically define a repository based on the deployment in [`repository.py`](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/blob/master/examples/project_fully_featured/project_fully_featured/repository.py) and are able to keep all code the same across testing, local development, staging, and production. Read more about our recommendations in [Transitioning Data Pipelines from Development to Production](/guides/dagster/transitioning-data-pipelines-from-development-to-production)

### For ops and graphs

<TODO>
Although assets are useful in many ways (...),

if your use case doesn't meet the criteria to use assets, you may still use graphs and ops, for example:

- Every day, send emails to a set of users
- Every day, read a file of user IDs and change the value of a particular attribute for each user
- Every day, scan my warehouse for tables that haven't been used in months and delete them

In these cases, ... we recommend defining ...

</TODO>

### For multiple repositories

So far, we've discussed our recommendations for structuring a large project which contains only one repository. Dagster also allows you to structure a project with multiple Dagster repositories. We don't recommend over-abstracting too early, and in most cases, one repository should be sufficient. The pattern we found useful is to use multiple repositories is to keep conflicting dependencies separate, where each Dagster repository can keep their own package requirements (e.g., `setup.py`) and deployment specs (e.g., `Dockerfile`).

<TODO>

- dagster believes what's .. should be captured by unit tests / CI/CD, to .. maintainable data application.
- checkout recommendations on unit tests: /guides/dagster/transitioning-data-pipelines-from-development-to-production#advanced-unit-tests-with-stubs-and-mocks
- follow pytest's recommendations
- you can test different entities separately. assets. sensors. resources

<TODO>

- as your data platform grows, you may use dagster to orchestrate other data tools, such as dbt project, jupyter notebooks.

  - dagster dbt can load dbt project into dagster assets
  - dagster notebook

- we recommend putting other projects together with dagster code so
  1. for people who are not familiar with dagster but want to develop against certain integrations, e.g. an analytics engineer, they can keep digging into the dbt project and quickly get their work done, while dagster can take care of testing and orchestrating their dbt models.
  2. you can keep code in sync easily - ?? dagster can read configs or manifests easily

</TODO>

## Conclusion

As your experience with Dagster grows, you may find certain aspects of this guide no longer apply to your use cases and you may want to change the structure to adapt to your business needs. We believe every team is unique and every team finds its own way to collaborate and be productive in the end.

We're constantly learning -- If you have anything you'd like to add about project layouts, we invite you to join this [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/discussions/8972) to share how you organize your Dagster code.
