# Snowflake + Dagster

Using Dagster's [Software-defined Assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) and a Snowflake [resource](/concepts/resources), you can easily interact with Snowflake tables alongside other Dagster assets.

Managing your Snowflake tables with Dagster enables you to:

- Use Python to analyze your data stored in Snowflake without writing custom SQL queries to fetch the data
- Visualize the data dependencies between tables
- Selectively update the contents of your tables
- Integrate your Snowflake tables with other tools in your data stack
