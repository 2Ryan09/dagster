# Intro to Dagster: Getting set up

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- **To install Python and pip.** This tutorial assumes that you have some familiarity with Python, but you should be able to follow along even if youâ€™re coming from a different programming language. To check that Python and `pip` (Python's package manager) are already installed in your environment or install them, follow the instructions [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

- **To install Dagster, Dagit, and the `requests` library**:

  ```shell
  pip install dagster dagit requests
  ```

  This installs the following Python packages:

  - `dagster` is the command line interface (CLI) tool to run Dagster. For more information, you can look at the [Dagster installation guide](/getting-started/install)
  - `dagit` is the web-based UI for developing and operating Dagster jobs, including a DAG browser, a type-aware config editor, and a live execution interface.
  - `requests` is not a part of Dagster, but you'll use it in the tutorial to download data from the internet.

## Troubleshooting Installations

If you are having issues with installing Dagster, Dagit, or any of its dependencies, you can look at the [Installation Troubleshooting Page](/getting-started/installation/troubleshooting-installation) for help and resources.
