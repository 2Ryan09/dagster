# Dagit UI

Dagit is a web-based interface for viewing and interacting with Dagster objects.

You can inspect op, job, and graph definitions, launch runs, view launched runs, and view assets produced by those runs.

---

## Launching Dagit

To launch the Dagit web server, run:

```shell
dagit
```

The command will print out the URL you can access the interface from in the browser, usually on port 3000.

When invoked, Dagit will fetch definitions - such as assets, jobs, schedules, sensors, and resources - from a <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object in a Python module or package or the code locations configured in an open source deployment's [workspace files](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/workspaces). Refer to the [Code location documentation](/concepts/code-locations) for more info.

## Navigating Dagit

These are the main pages inside Dagit:

- [Jobs](#jobs)
- [Runs](#runs)
- [Assets](#assets)
- [Schedules and sensors](#schedules-and-sensors)
- [Instance status](#instance-status)

### Jobs

The Job page offers tools to explore a job definition and launch runs for that job.

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Overview tab">

#### Overview tab

The **Overview** tab shows the graph of ops that make up a job.

- [Job definition](#job-definition)
- [Op definition](#op-definition)

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Runs tab">

#### Runs tab

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

### Runs

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="All runs">

#### All runs

The Runs page lists all job runs, which can be filtered by job name, run ID, execution status, or tag. Click a run ID to open the [**Run details** page](#run-details) and view details for that run:

/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Run details">

#### Run details

The **Run details** page contains details about a single run, including timing information, errors, and logs.

The upper left pane contains a Gantt chart, indicating how long each op took to execute. The bottom pane displays filterable events and logs emitted during the course of execution:

/>

From the **Run details** page, you can also re-execute a run using the same configuration by clicking the **Re-execute** dropdown:

<Image
alt="Dagit Re-execution"
src="/images/concepts/dagit/re-execution.png"
width={3808}
height={2414}
/>

There are several re-execution options:

- **All Steps**: Re-execute the run from scratch.
- **Selected Steps**: Re-execute the selected steps.
- **From Selected**: Re-execute the steps downstream from the selected steps
- **From Failure**: Retry the run, skipping steps completed successfully. This is only enabled when the run has failed.

Related runs (e.g., runs created by re-executing the same previous run) are grouped together in the right pane for easy reference.
