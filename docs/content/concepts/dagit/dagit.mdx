# Dagit UI

Dagit is a web-based interface for viewing and interacting with Dagster objects.

You can inspect op, job, and graph definitions, launch runs, view launched runs, and view assets produced by those runs.

---

## Accessing Dagit

Dagit fetches definitions - jobs, ops, schedules, sensors - from a set of repositories configured in `workspace.yaml`. It fetches runs and assets from storage, configured in an instance's `dagster.yaml`.

### Locally

To launch the Dagit web server locally, run the following:

```shell
dagit
```

The command will print out the URL you can access the interface from in the browser, usually on port 3000.

### Dagster Cloud

To access Dagit on Dagster Cloud:

1. Navigate to the [sign in page](https://dagster.cloud/)
2. Enter your organization's URL
3. Complete the authentication process.

## Runs

The Runs page lists all job runs. You can filter the list by job name, run ID, execution status, or tag. Click a run ID to view details for that run.

### Viewing a single run

The Run page provides details for a single run, including timing information, errors, and logs.

The upper left pane contains a Gantt chart, indicating how long each op took to execute. The bottom pane displays filterable events and logs emitted during the course of execution.

### Re-executing a run

The Run page also allows you to re-execute a run with the same configuration. Click the "Re-execution" dropdown button. There are several re-execution options:

<Image

/>

- **All Steps**: Re-execute the run from scratch.
- **Selected Steps**: Re-execute the selected steps.
- **From Selected**: Re-execute the steps downstream from the selected steps
- **From Failure**: Retry the run, skipping steps completed successfully. This is only enabled when the run has failed.

Related runs (e.g., runs created by re-executing the same previous run) are now grouped together in the right pane for easy reference.
