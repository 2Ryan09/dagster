    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Software-defined Asset</strong> (
        <PyObject object="asset" decorator />)
      </td>
      <td>
        An asset is an object in persistent storage, such as a database table, a
        file, or a machine learning model. A Software-defined Asset a
        description, in code, of an asset that should exist, including how it's
        produced and updated.
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>A table in a database, such as Snowflake or PostgreSQL</li>
          <li>A file in Amazon S3</li>
          <li>
            An asset from an integration, such as a dbt model or a Fivetran
            connector
          </li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Graph-backed Asset</strong> (
        <PyObject object="graph_asset" decorator />)
      </td>
      <td>
        Graph-backed Assets are made up of a graph of ops. This type of asset is
        useful when generating an asset that involves several discrete
        computations, or several steps to arrive at a result.

    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Multi-asset</strong> (
        <PyObject object="multi_asset" decorator />)
      </td>
      <td>
        A set of Software-defined Assets that are updated by the same op or
        graph. Multi-assets can be used to define a single op or graph and
        produce the contents of multiple data assets at once.
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>A single API call updating multiple tables</li>
          <li>An in-memory object used to compute multiple assets</li>

      <td>
        <strong>External Asset</strong> (<code>external_asset_from_spec</code>)
      </td>
      <td>
        An asset that is visible in the Dagster UI, but executed by a process
        external to Dagster. This type of asset is essentially a piece of
        metadata in an asset graph - it represents a data asset, but Dagster
        doesn't materialize it.

      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>A daily file drop into Amazon S3</li>
          <li>A manually created spreadsheet</li>
