# External assets (Experimental)

An external asset is an asset that is not materialized by Dagster, but is tracked in the asset graph and asset catalog.

## Defining External Assets

### A single external asset

The following code declares a single external asset and passes it to <PyObject object="Definitions"/>

```python file=/concepts/assets/external_assets/single_declaration.py
from dagster import AssetSpec, Definitions
from dagster._core.definitions.external_asset import external_asset_from_spec

defs = Definitions(assets=[external_asset_from_spec(AssetSpec("my_asset"))])
```

## What about Source Assets?

A common use case for external assets is modeling data produced by an process not under Dagster's control. For example a daily drop of a file from a third party in s3.

In most systems these are described as sources. This includes Dagster, which includes&#xA;<PyObject object="SourceAsset" displayText="SourceAsset" />&#xA;which will be supplanted by external assets in the near-term&#xA;future, as external assets are a superset of the functionality&#xA;of Source Assets.
