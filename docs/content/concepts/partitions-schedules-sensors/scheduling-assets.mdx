# Scheduling assets

<Note>
  This page is specific to <strong>Software-defined Assets (SDAs)</strong>.
  Looking for ops? Refer to the{" "}
  <a href="/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/partitioning-ops">

  </a>{" "}
  documentation.
</Note>

Each schedule:

- Targets a single job
- Optionally defines a function that returns either:
  - One or more <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> objects. Each run request launches a run.
  - An optional <PyObject object="SkipReason"/>, which specifies a message which describes why no runs were requested
    on in the Dagster UI.

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, you should be familiar with:

- [Software-defined Assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets)
- [Jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs)

## Defining schedules

- [Schedules for assets](#schedules-for-assets)
- [Schedules for partitioned assets](#schedules-for-partitioned-assets)

### Schedules for assets

To run schedules for assets, you can [build a job that materializes assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#building-jobs-that-materialize-assets) and construct a <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" />:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/schedules.py startafter=start_basic_asset_schedule endbefore=end_basic_asset_schedule
from dagster import AssetSelection, define_asset_job

asset_job = define_asset_job("asset_job", AssetSelection.groups("some_asset_group"))

basic_schedule = ScheduleDefinition(job=asset_job, cron_schedule="0 0 * * *")
```

### Schedules for partitioned assets

The Partitioned Jobs concepts page also includes an [example of a date-partitioned asset](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/partitioning-assets#defining-partitioned-assets). You can define a schedule similarly using <PyObject object="build_schedule_from_partitioned_job"/>:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedule_from_partitions.py startafter=start_partitioned_asset_schedule endbefore=end_partitioned_asset_schedule
from dagster import (
    asset,
    build_schedule_from_partitioned_job,
    define_asset_job,
    HourlyPartitionsDefinition,
)


@asset(partitions_def=HourlyPartitionsDefinition(start_date="2020-01-01-00:00"))
def hourly_asset():
    ...


partitioned_asset_job = define_asset_job("partitioned_job", selection=[hourly_asset])


asset_partitioned_schedule = build_schedule_from_partitioned_job(
    partitioned_asset_job,
)
```

## Running the scheduler

Schedules must be started for them to run. Schedules can be started and stopped:

- In the Dagster UI using the **Schedules** tab:

  <Image
    alt="Schedules tab in the Dagster UI"
    src="/images/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules-tab-toggle.png"
    width={1164}
    height={280}
  />

- Using the CLI:

  ```shell
  dagster schedule start
  dagster schedule stop
  ```

- In code by setting the schedule's default status to `DefaultScheduleStatus.RUNNING`:

  ```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/schedules.py startafter=start_running_in_code endbefore=end_running_in_code
  my_running_schedule = ScheduleDefinition(
      job=my_job, cron_schedule="0 9 * * *", default_status=DefaultScheduleStatus.RUNNING
  )
  ```

If you manually start or stop a schedule in the UI, that overrides any default status set in code.

Once the schedule is started, the schedule will begin executing immediately if you're running the [dagster-daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon) process as part of your deployment. Refer to the [Troubleshooting](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules#troubleshooting) section if your schedule has been started but isn't submitting runs.
