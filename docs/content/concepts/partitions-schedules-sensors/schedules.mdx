# Schedules

Schedules are the most traditional way to keep your data up-to-date. Schedules define a fixed time interval to run your pipeline, such as daily, hourly, or Monday at 9:00 AM.

A schedule is a Dagster definition that is used to execute a [job](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs) at a fixed interval, such as daily, hourly, or Monday at 9:00 AM. Each time at which a schedule is evaluated is called a _tick_. The schedule definition can generate run configuration for the job on each tick.

Dagster includes a scheduler, which is a process that periodically checks for schedules that need to be evaluated. When a schedule is evaluated, the scheduler submits a run for the job.

## Benefits

Using schedules provides the following benefits:

- **Automation**: Schedules allow you to automate the execution of your pipelines.
- **Observablity**: Schedules provide a way to view the history of runs for a job and ticks for a schedule in the UI. It makes it easy to see when a job was last run and what the run's status was.
- **Parameterization**: Schedules can be customized to run with different run config and tags each time they execute. For example, you might want to run a job with a different date each time it executes.

## Uses

Schedules are supported for both Software-defined Assets and ops, but how each concept is used is unique. Refer to the following documentation for more info:

- [Scheduling assets](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/scheduling-assets)
- [Scheduling ops](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/scheduling-ops) (Advanced)
- [Testing schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/testing-schedules)

With schedules, you can:

- View details of a schedule, such as tick history and run history, in the [Dagster UI](/concepts/webserver/ui#schedules).
- View all schedules defined in your Dagster deployment in the [Dagster UI](/concepts/webserver/ui#all-schedules).
- Adjust schedule execution times, timezone, and conditions. For example, you might want to skip a run if the data hasn't changed since the last time the schedule ran.
- Paramterize run configuration and tags for a run. For example, you might want to run a job with a different configuration each time it executes.
