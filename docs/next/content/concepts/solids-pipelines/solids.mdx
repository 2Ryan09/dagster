# Solids

<Counter />

The core abstraction of Dagster is the _solid_. A solid is a functional unit of computation. It has defined inputs and
outputs, and multiple solids can be wired together to form a <PyObject module="dagster" object="PipelineDefinition" displayText="Pipeline" /> by
defining dependencies between solid inputs and outputs.

A solid has a number of properties:

- Coarse-grained and for use in batch computations.
- Defines inputs and outputs, optionally typed within the Dagster type system.
- Embeddable in a dependency graph (pipeline) that is constructed by connecting the inputs and outputs of
  multiple solids.
- Emits a stream of typed, structured events &mdash; such as expectations and materializations &mdash;
  corresponding to the semantics of its computation.
- Exposes self-describing, strongly typed configuration.
- Testable and reusable.

## Defining a solid

There are two ways to define a solid:

1.  Wrap a python function in the <PyObject module="dagster" object="solid" displayText="@solid" /> decorator
    _\[Preferred\]_
2.  Construct a <PyObject module="dagster" object="SolidDefinition"/> object

**Method 1: Using the decorator**

To use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="solid" displayText="@solid" /> decorator,
wrap a function that takes a `context` argument as the first
parameter. The context is provides access to system information such as
resources and solid configuration. See [Solid Context](#solid-context) for more information.
