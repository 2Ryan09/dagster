# Connecting Solids in Pipelines

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/basics/e03_pipelines/" />

Our pipelines wouldn't be very interesting if they were limited to solids acting in isolation from
each other. Pipelines are useful because they let us connect solids into arbitrary
[DAGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of computation.

Dagster pipelines model a _dataflow_ graph. In data pipelines, the reason that a later step comes after
an earlier step is almost always that it uses data produced by the earlier step. Dagster models
these dataflow dependencies with _inputs_ and _outputs_.

## Let's Get Serial

We'll expand the pipeline we worked with in the first section of the tutorial into two solids:

- The first solid will read the cereal dataset from the CSV and return it as an output.
- The second solid will consume the cereals produced by the first solid and find the most caloric
  cereal.

```python literalinclude caption=serial_pipeline.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/basics/e03_pipelines/serial_pipeline.py
startAfter:start_serial_pipeline_marker_0
endBefore:end_serial_pipeline_marker_0
```

You'll see that we've modified our existing `load_cereals` solid to return an output, in this case
the list of dicts representing the cereals dataset.

We've defined our new solid, `sort_by_calories`, to take a user-defined input, `cereals`, in
addition to the system-provided <PyObject module="dagster" object="SystemComputeExecutionContext"
displayText="context" /> object.

We can use inputs and outputs to connect solids to each other. Here we tell Dagster that:

- `load_cereals` doesn't depend on the output of any other solid.
- `sort_by_calories` depends on the output of `load_cereals`.

Let's visualize this pipeline in Dagit:

```bash
dagit -f serial_pipeline.py
```

Navigate to

or choose "serial_pipeline" from the left sidebar:

## A More Complex DAG

Solids don't need to be wired together serially. The output of one solid can be consumed by any
number of other solids, and the outputs of several different solids can be consumed by a single
solid.

```python literalinclude showLines caption=complex_pipeline.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/basics/e03_pipelines/complex_pipeline.py
startAfter:start_complex_pipeline_marker_0
endBefore:end_complex_pipeline_marker_0
```

First we introduce the intermediate variable `cereals` into our pipeline definition to represent the
output of the `load_cereals` solid. Then we make both `sort_by_calories` and `sort_by_protein`
consume this output. Their outputs are in turn both consumed by `display_results`.

Let's visualize this pipeline in Dagit:

```bash
dagit -f complex_pipeline.py
```

![complex_pipeline_figure_one.png](/images/tutorial/complex_pipeline_figure_one.png)

When you execute this example from Dagit, you'll see that `load_cereals` executes first, followed by
`sort_by_calories` and `sort_by_protein`—in any order—and that `display_results`
executes last, only after `sort_by_calories` and `sort_by_protein` have both executed.

In more sophisticated execution environments, `sort_by_calories` and `sort_by_protein` could execute
not just in any order, but at the same time, since they don't depend on each other's
outputs—but both would still have to execute after `load_cereals` (because they depend on its
output) and before `display_results` (because `display_results` depends on both of their outputs).

We'll write a simple test for this pipeline showing how we can assert that all four of its solids
executed successfully.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=73 caption=complex_pipeline.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/basics/e03_pipelines/complex_pipeline.py
startAfter: start_complex_pipeline_marker_1
endBefore: end_complex_pipeline_marker_1
```
