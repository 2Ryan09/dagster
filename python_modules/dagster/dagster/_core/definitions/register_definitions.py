    Make a set of definitions explicitly available and loadable by dagster tools.

    Dagster separates user-defined code from system tools such the web server and
    the daemon. These tools must be able to locate and load this code when they start.
    Python modules that dagster tools can load are known as "code locations".

    A code location is defined as a python module that has either:

    (1) Has one or more dagster definitions as module-level attributes (e.g. a function
    declared at the top-level of a module decorated with @asset).

    or

    (2) A module that contains an explicit call to register_definitions.

    alts:
    dagsterify_module
    make_module_loadable
    defined_loadable_module
    definitions_in_module
    register_definitions

    For anything beyond lightweight testing and exploration, the use of register_definitions
    is strongly recommended.

    This function provides a few conveniences for the user that do not apply to vanilla dagster
    definitions:

    (1) It takes a dictionary of top-level resources which are automatically bound
    (via with_resources) to any asset passed to it. If you need to apply different
    resources to different assets, use legacy @repository and use with_resources as before.

    (2) The resources dictionary takes raw python objects, not just resource definitions.

    Invoking this function dynamically injects an attribute named "__registered_definitions" into
    the calling module that contains a handle to the definitions.
